LangChain is an open-source framework for developing applications powered by language models. It helps developers build context-aware and reasoning-capable LLM applications by chaining together modular components like prompt templates, models, memory, tools, and agents.

With LangChain, you can:
- Connect LLMs to external data (like files, databases, or APIs).
- Build multi-step reasoning chains (e.g., question-answering with retrieval).
- Integrate tools like search engines, calculators, or Python interpreters.
- Create conversational agents with memory and long-term context.

LangChain supports models like OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face, and Ollama. It also integrates with vector databases like FAISS, Chroma, and Pinecone for efficient retrieval.

LangChain is widely used in building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, autonomous agents, chatbots, and custom LLM apps.
